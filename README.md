# ml-classify-go

A Go-based machine learning classification project. This project is structured to follow standard Go best practices for command-line applications.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Go project layout:

```
ml-classify-go/
├── cmd/
│   └── ml-classify-go/
│       └── main.go   # Main application entry point
├── data/             # Contains data files for the application
├── internal/         # For non-exposed, reusable internal packages
├── model/            # Contains machine learning model files
├── pkg/              # For reusable, exported packages (if any)
├── scripts/
│   └── splitdata.sh  # Script for data splitting (assumed purpose)
├── .gitignore        # Git ignore file
├── go.mod            # Go module definition
├── Makefile          # Build automation for cross-compilation
└── README.md         # This README file
```

## How to Build and Use

This project uses a `Makefile` for easy building and cross-compilation.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Go (Golang) installed (version 1.24.3 or higher recommended).
    *   `make` utility.

2.  **Building the Application:**
    Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.

    *   **Build for Linux:**
        ```bash
        make linux
        ```
        This will create a `ml-classify-go-linux` executable in the `bin/` directory.

    *   **Build for Windows:**
        ```bash
        make windows
        ```
        This will create a `ml-classify-go-windows.exe` executable in the `bin/` directory.

    *   **Build for All Supported OS (Linux and Windows):**
        ```bash
        make all
        ```
        This will build executables for both Linux and Windows.

    *   **Clean Build Artifacts:**
        ```bash
        make clean
        ```
        This will remove the `bin/` directory and all compiled binaries.

3.  **Running the Application:**
    After building, you can run the executable from the `bin/` directory:
    ```bash
    ./bin/ml-classify-go-linux # On Linux
    .\bin\ml-classify-go-windows.exe # On Windows
    ```
    (Further usage instructions would depend on the application's specific command-line arguments and functionality.)

4.  **Data Preparation:**
    The `scripts/splitdata.sh` script is likely used for preparing or splitting your dataset. You can run it from the project root:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/splitdata.sh
    ```
    (Consult the script's content for specific usage and parameters.)

## Application Modes (Conceptual Examples)

The `ml-classify-go` application is designed to support different operational modes, typically controlled via command-line subcommands or flags. Below are conceptual examples of how 'train', 'predict', and 'interactive' modes would function.



### How to Use (Concrete Examples):

Once you implement the logic within `cmd/ml-classify-go/main.go` and build the application using the `Makefile`, you would run the commands as follows:

First, build the application (e.g., for Linux):
```bash
make linux
```
This will create the executable `./bin/ml-classify-go-linux`.

Then, you can use it:

1.  **Train Mode:**
    To train a model, specifying your training data and where to save the trained model:
    ```bash
    ./bin/ml-classify-go-linux train --data data/your_training_dataset.csv --output model/your_trained_model.bin
    ```
    (You can also add other flags like `--epochs` as discussed in the `README.md`.)

2.  **Predict Mode:**
    To make predictions using a trained model on new data:
    ```bash
    ./bin/ml-classify-go-linux predict --model model/your_trained_model.bin --input data/your_prediction_dataset.csv --output predictions.csv
    ```

3.  **Interactive Mode:**
    To start an interactive session for real-time classification:
    ```bash
    ./bin/ml-classify-go-linux interactive --model model/your_trained_model.bin
    ```
    (After running this, the application would prompt you for input.)

## Development Acknowledgment

This project was developed with significant assistance from **claude.ai** and **Gemini CLI**, leveraging their capabilities for code structuring, best practices, and automation.
